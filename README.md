### Python Example
This example demonstrates how to download an image using the `requests` library in Python. It fetches an image from the specified API endpoint and saves it locally.

python
import requests

def download_image(image_url, save_path):
    try:
        response = requests.get(image_url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Check for HTTP errors

        with open(save_path, 'wb') as file:
            file.write(response.content)
        print(f"Image downloaded and saved to {save_path}")

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage
image_url = "https://hdstockimages.com/patreon-image-and-photo-downloader/some-image.jpg"
download_image(image_url, "downloaded_image.jpg")


### PHP Example
In this PHP example, we use cURL to download an image from the API and save it to a local file. Error checking is included for the cURL operation.

php
<?php

function downloadImage($imageUrl, $savePath) {
    $ch = curl_init($imageUrl);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

    $imageData = curl_exec($ch);
    if (curl_errno($ch)) {
        echo 'Error: ' . curl_error($ch);
        curl_close($ch);
        return;
    }
    curl_close($ch);

    file_put_contents($savePath, $imageData);
    echo "Image downloaded and saved to $savePath\n";
}

// Example usage
$imageUrl = "https://hdstockimages.com/patreon-image-and-photo-downloader/some-image.jpg";
downloadImage($imageUrl, "downloaded_image.jpg");
?>


### JavaScript Example
This example shows how to use the Fetch API to download an image in JavaScript. It works both in the browser and in Node.js (with node-fetch).

javascript
async function downloadImage(imageUrl, savePath) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(imageUrl);
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        
        const blob = await response.blob();
        const link = document.createElement('a');
        link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
        link.download = savePath;
        link.click();
        
        console.log(`Image downloaded and saved as ${savePath}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('An error occurred:', error);
    }
}

// Example usage (in browser)
const imageUrl = "https://hdstockimages.com/patreon-image-and-photo-downloader/some-image.jpg";
downloadImage(imageUrl, "downloaded_image.jpg");

// Note: In Node.js, use a library like 'node-fetch' to replace the fetch function and write to a file.
